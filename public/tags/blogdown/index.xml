      <description>This year has been rather rewarding for me! After completing some of the excellent Business Science University courses, I have worked on a number of Customer Analytics &amp;amp; Business Intelligence projects and summarised them into technical articles that I published on Medium&amp;rsquo;s Towards Data Science. This opened up an entirely new world to me and generated many new connections within the analytics and data science community the world over!</description>
