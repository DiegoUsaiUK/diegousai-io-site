      <description>With the new year, I started to look for new employment opportunities and even managed to land a handful of final stage interviews before it all grounded to a halt following the corona-virus pandemic. Invariably, as part of the selection process I was asked to analyse a set of data and compile a number of data driven-recommendations to present in my final meeting.
In this post I retrace the steps I took for one of the take home analysis I was tasked with and revisit clustering, one of my favourite analytic methods.</description>

      <description>Clustering is one of my favourite analytic methods: it resonates well with clients as I&amp;rsquo;ve found from my consulting experience, and is a relatively straightforward concept to explain non technical audiences.
Earlier this year I&amp;rsquo;ve used the popular K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their response to a series of marketing campaigns. For that post I&amp;rsquo;ve deliberately used a basic dataset to show that it is not only a relatively easy analysis to carry out but can also help unearthing interesting patterns of behaviour in your customer base even when using few customer attributes.</description>

      <description>Market segmentation refers to the process of dividing a consumer market of existing and/or potential customers into groups (or segments) based on shared attributes, interests, and behaviours.
For this mini-project I will use the popular K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their response to a series of marketing campaigns. The basic concept is that consumers who share common traits would respond to marketing communication in a similar way so that companies can reach out for each group in a relevant and effective way.</description>
