      <description>Traditional approaches to time series analysis and forecasting, like Linear Regression, Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing, ARMA/ARIMA/SARIMA and ARCH/GARCH, have been well-established for decades and find applications in fields as varied as business and finance (e.g. predict stock prices and analyse trends in financial markets), the energy sector (e.g. forecast electricity consumption) and academia (e.g. measure socio-political phenomena).
In more recent times, the popularisation and wider availability of open source frameworks like Keras, TensorFlow and scikit-learn helped machine learning approaches like Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Time Delay Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network to gain momentum in time series applications.</description>

      <title>A gentle Introduction to Customer Segmentation - Using K-Means Clustering to Understand Marketing Response</title>

      <description>Market segmentation refers to the process of dividing a consumer market of existing and/or potential customers into groups (or segments) based on shared attributes, interests, and behaviours.
For this mini-project I will use the popular K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their response to a series of marketing campaigns. The basic concept is that consumers who share common traits would respond to marketing communication in a similar way so that companies can reach out for each group in a relevant and effective way.</description>
