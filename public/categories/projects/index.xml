      <description>In this day and age, a business that leverages data to understand the drivers of its customers&amp;rsquo; behaviour has a true competitive advantage. Organisations can dramatically improve their performance in the market by analysing customer level data in an effective way and focus their efforts towards those that are more likely to engage.
One trialled and tested approach to tease out this type of insight is Propensity Modelling, which combines information such as a customers’ demographics (age, race, religion, gender, family size, ethnicity, income, education level), psycho-graphic (social class, lifestyle and personality characteristics), engagement (emails opened, emails clicked, searches on mobile app, webpage dwell time, etc.</description>

      <description>This is the minimal coding necessary to assemble various data feeds and sort out the likes of variables naming &amp;amp; new features creation plus some general housekeeping tasks. It includes general housekeeping tasks like sorting variables names, creating essential features and sorting out variables order
I will continue to add to this code should the need arise for other features to be created.
The Dataset library(tidyverse) library(lubridate) library(readr)  The dataset I&amp;rsquo;m using here accompanies a Redbooks publication called Building 360-Degree Information Applications which is available as a free PDF download.</description>

      <description>My objective for this piece of work is to carry out a Market Basket Analysis as an end-to-end data science project. I have split the output into three parts, of which this is the THIRD and last, that I have organised as follows:
 In the first chapter, I will source, explore and format a complex dataset suitable for modelling with recommendation algorithms.
 For the second part, I will apply various machine learning algorithms for Product Recommendation and select the best performing model.</description>
